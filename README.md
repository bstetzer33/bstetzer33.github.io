# Benjamin Stetzer — Portfolio (Next.js + Tailwind + TypeScript)

This repository is a starter portfolio site for Benjamin Stetzer built with Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and a set of shadcn-style UI components.

Quickstart

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Notes

- The project uses `next-themes` for dark/light theming.
- The `app/api/contact` route logs contact form submissions to the server console.
- UI components are implemented in `components/ui` following a shadcn-style pattern and are Tailwind-based.

You can adapt, extend, and replace the example projects and content with real information.
